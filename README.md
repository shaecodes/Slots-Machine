Slot Machine Game
This is a simple implementation of a slot machine game in Python. The game allows the player to deposit money, place bets on multiple lines, spin the slot machine, and win or lose money based on the outcome of the spin.

# Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone or download the source code as a ZIP file.

Open the slot_machine.py file in a Python IDE or text editor.

Run the slot_machine.py file to start the game.

# Game Rules
The player starts with a balance, which they can deposit to begin playing the game.

The player can choose the number of lines they want to bet on, with a maximum of 3 lines.

The player can place a bet on each line, with a minimum bet of $1 and a maximum bet of $100.

After placing the bets, the player can spin the slot machine, which generates a random outcome.

The outcome is displayed as a grid of symbols, where each symbol represents a value.

If the symbols on a line match, the player wins based on the value of the symbols and the bet placed on that line.

The player can continue to play by pressing enter, or quit the game by typing 'q'.

The game ends when the player decides to quit or runs out of balance.

# How to Play
Run the slot_machine.py file.

Enter the amount you want to deposit to start the game.

Follow the prompts to choose the number of lines and place bets on each line.

Press enter to spin the slot machine and see the outcome.

If you win, the winnings are added to your balance. If you lose, the bet amount is deducted from your balance.

Continue playing by pressing enter or quit the game by typing 'q'.
